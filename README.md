# 🚧 Portfolio Projects 🚧

+ SimpleGFX Game (4th Week)
+ Map Editor (5th Week)
+ Web Server (6th Week)
+ TCP Concurrent Chat (7th Week)
+ Networking Game (7th Week)
+ Hackathon Project (13th Week)
+ Single Page Application (final week JS project)
+ Whatever personal projects you may have

Basically, anything that is built upon a codebase of <Academia de Código_> cannot be used - such as the Car Crash exercise. Some of the earlier exercises solve problems that might be too small and simple to include in the portfolio, such as the GuessANumber/RockPaperScissors challenges.

Also remember to include in the description of these projects what week of the bootcamp you were in and how many days of x skill you had. For example: SimpleGFX Game project made after 4 weeks of Java or the WebServer was made after 3 days of networking!

Goes without saying (but I must), don't put up any of <A/C_> implementations on your portfolios.

# 🏦 JavaBank RoadMap 🏦

An unofficial roadmap of the skills you learned during this major project - I've included some JavaScript skills as well. Use this as a refresher/guide on points to prep before an interview if you like.

### 👀 User Interface 👀

PromptView: terminal interface, input/output streams, scanners, etc.

HTML5 && CSS: Bootstrap, flexbox, etc.
Thymeleaf: dynamic templating

### ✔️ Design Patterns 🧬

+ Factory (used in JavaBank)
+ Strategy (used in JavaBank)
+ State (state machine of TCP handshake)
+ Builder (StringBuilder pattern)
+ Observer 
+ Singleton (used by Spring in bean creation)
+ Decorator (used by BufferedReader())

These are some examples and what context they were mentioned during the bootcamp. Choose a few and familiarize yourselves with the problem they solve and how they do it.

### ✔️ MVC and Service Layer 🔄	

Architectural pattern, separation of responsability, layer pattern.

### ✔️ Maven

Replaced build.xml + ANT command. Project and dependency manager + build tool.

### ✔️ Tests

TDD, JUnit (unit testing), Mockito.

### ✔️ Databases

MySQL, Relational Databases, ACID, Database Normalization.

### ✔️ JDBC

Java Database Connector

### ✔️ JPA

ORM, Hibernate, Annotation Mappings, Criteria Queries, JPQL.

### ✔️ Enterprise Application

JavaEE, Data Access Objects, Transactions, Three Tier Architecture.

### ✔️ Spring

Dependency Injection, XML defined beans, AOP.

### ✔️ Java Web

JSP, Servlets, Web Container (Tomcat), web descriptor (web.xml)

### ✔️ SpringMVC

Annotation defined beans, Front Controller pattern, thymeleaf view resolver, autowiring.

DTO: Data Transfer Objects - not related to Spring but applied during this phase.

### ✔️ REST

Web service, uses HTTP protocol, JSON, postman for testing.

### ✔️ JS Web Development

DOM API, AJAX, JQuery, dev tools for testing.
